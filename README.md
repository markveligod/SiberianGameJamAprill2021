## 🎮GamePlay
### 🌆Story
You are the mayor of the town of Insmouth. The last days are coming, and now your boss is no longer the governor, the council of the Democratic Party, or even the taxpayers. Now you work for the dark Lord Cthulhu.  
Will you be able to rally his minions around you, or will you fall victim to their intrigues? Will you be able to prepare the city for the reception of such an important guest and keep the post until he appears? Be careful, you should not forget about ordinary residents either.  

### 🕹️Control
Rotation camera - Left and right keyboard button  
PAUSE - P

### 📜Rules
Your city has four main indicators : cultist influence, economy, amphibian population, and flooding. If one of them falls below 20 or rises above 90, the game is lost.  
Your task is to maintain the delicate balance in Innsmouth until the arrival of the great Cthulhu.
